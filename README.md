# Browserpad

A browser-based plain text editor built entirely with HTML, CSS and JavaScript:

> http://browserpad.org
   
Browserpad will always be a
   **[plaintext](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor#Plain_text_files_vs._word_processor_files)** editor:
   no markdown/html preview, no WYSIWIG, no rich text editing.

Hopefully this guiding principle will prevent feature creep
   and keep the tool focused,
   the [Unix way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Doug_McIlroy_on_Unix_programming).

### Inspiration:
* The concept was originally decribed by [@jjperezaguinaga](https://github.com/jjperezaguinaga)
  on his 4 Dec 2012 post "[One line browser notepad](https://coderwall.com/p/lhsrcq/one-line-browser-notepad)".
    * It appears that it had been previously uncovered by [@tabatkins](https://github.com/tabatkins),
      as evidenced by [this 29 Jan 2012 tweet](https://twitter.com/paul_irish/status/163692631128424449)
      by [@paulirish](https://github.com/paulirish).
    * [This 9 December 2011 Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3333093)
      by [@bytex64](https://github.com/bytex64) mentions a talk about HTML5 where this was presented
    * TODO: contact @tabatkins and @bytex64 to investigate this further and get to the bottom of it
      (although maybe this may be irrelevant if we abandon the Data URI concept,
      not to mention it is definitely not small anymore;
      but it may still be nice to have the origins of Browserpad documented).
* Online plaintext editors (closed-source):

    * [editpad.org](http://editpad.org)
* Features:

    * [textop.us](http://wayback.archive.org/web/20130718231049id_/http://textop.us/) (defunct)
    * [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor#Typical_features)

### Primary features:
> Note: As a rule of thumb, Browserpad aims to support only editing operations that are generic and content-agnostic.
> This means it won't implement any context-sensitive functions that depend on the semantic meaning of the text,
> such as bracket matching, code highlighting / linting / beautifying,
> [semantic linebreaks](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/), etc.
